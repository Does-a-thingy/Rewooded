      About Us
      </h3>
      <p class='text1'>
         We are Rewooded, a small sustainable business created by five year 11 Henderson high school students. Together we hope to tackle the ever growing problems of New Zealand's construction waste, 40 - 50% of all waste sent to landfill in New Zealand and we are hoping to make a product that doesn't add to this. Together with the recreators, a community based business focused around reducing our environmental impact, we have created sustainable coffee tables from reclaimed timber that are ethical, sustainable and good-looking too!
